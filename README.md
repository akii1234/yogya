# 🚀 Yogya – Your Talent Intelligence Partner

## 📌 Why Yogya?

**Hiring today is broken.**

Resumes are keyword-matched, not understood.

Interviews are subjective and biased.

HR spends endless hours screening, yet still misses great talent.

Yogya changes this. We are not an ATS. We are an **AI-powered competency intelligence engine** that empowers organizations to hire fairly, faster, and smarter.

## 🎯 Core Value Proposition

- **Competency-Based Hiring**: Assess candidates on real skills, not just credentials
- **AI Interview Agent**: Structured, bias-free interviewing aligned to STAR/CAR methods
- **Candidate Ranking Engine**: Multi-factor scoring (skills, experience, competencies, culture fit)
- **Bias Reduction**: Transparent, explainable scoring for HR and candidates

## 🧩 How Yogya Works

### 1. Job → Competency Framework
HR uploads a job description. Yogya's AI extracts competencies (e.g., Python basics, OOP, problem-solving, collaboration).

### 2. Resume → Competency Mapping
Candidates upload resumes. Yogya maps experience + skills to the job's competency framework.

### 3. AI-Driven Interview Questions
Yogya generates competency-based questions (STAR/CAR). Questions test not just knowledge but application and decision-making.

### 4. AI Interview Agent
Optional AI agent conducts round-1 interviews:
- Asks structured questions
- Analyzes candidate answers (text/audio)
- Scores responses against competencies

### 5. Ranking & Insights
Candidates are ranked fairly using:
- **40%** → Competency Match
- **30%** → Experience Depth
- **20%** → Problem-Solving & Learning Agility
- **10%** → Culture Fit & Communication

HR sees a clear shortlist with insights.

## 🖥️ User Journeys

## 🧠 Competency Engine ⭐ CORE

### Core Competencies
Yogya's competency engine is built around **6 core competencies** that predict real-world job performance:

| Competency | Description | STAR Prompt | Weightage |
|------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Problem Solving** | Logical breakdown, analytical thinking | "Tell me about a time you debugged a critical bug." | 20% |
| **Communication** | Clarity in expressing ideas, especially technical concepts | "Describe a time you had to explain tech to a non-tech stakeholder." | 15% |
| **Collaboration** | Teamwork, conflict resolution | "When did you help a struggling team member?" | 15% |
| **Ownership** | Initiative, accountability | "Give an example where you took ownership of a delivery." | 20% |
| **Learning Agility** | Curiosity, adaptability | "Tell me when you picked up a new tech under tight deadline." | 10% |
| **Technical Depth** | Engineering fundamentals, architecture thinking | "Describe the most complex system you've built or contributed to." | 20% |

### STAR/CAR Methodology
- **STAR**: Situation, Task, Action, Result
- **CAR**: Context, Action, Result
- **SOAR**: Situation, Obstacle, Action, Result

### Competency Framework System
- **CompetencyFramework**: Role-specific frameworks (e.g., "Python Developer - Mid Level")
- **Competency**: Individual competencies with behavioral methodology
- **InterviewTemplate**: Structured interview templates with weighted competencies
- **InterviewQuestion**: Questions mapped to specific competencies
- **CompetencyEvaluation**: Structured scoring with transparency and audit trail
