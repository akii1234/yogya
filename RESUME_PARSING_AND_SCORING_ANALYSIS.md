The resume parsing and scoring service is a **multi-stage pipeline** that:

1. **Extracts text** from various resume formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
2. **Processes and normalizes** the extracted text using NLP
3. **Extracts structured information** (skills, experience, education)
4. **Calculates match scores** between candidates and job descriptions
5. **Provides detailed analysis** with recommendations

### **Service Components:**
- **File Processing**: PDF/DOCX text extraction
- **NLP Processing**: Text preprocessing, skill extraction

## üîÑ Parsing Pipeline

### **Stage 1: File Upload & Text Extraction**
```python
def extract_text_from_file(file_input):
    """
    Extracts text from PDF, DOCX, or TXT files
    """
    # 1. Determine file type
    # 2. Use appropriate parser:
    #    - PDF: PyPDF2 PdfReader
    #    - DOCX: python-docx Document
    #    - TXT: Direct text reading
    # 3. Extract raw text
    # 4. Basic cleaning (remove extra whitespace)
```

### **Stage 2: NLP Preprocessing**
```python
def preprocess_text(text):
    """
    Preprocesses text for NLP operations
    """
    # 1. Convert to lowercase
    # 2. Remove special characters
    # 3. Tokenize text
    # 4. Remove stop words (with custom exceptions)
    # 5. Lemmatize words
    # 6. Join back to text
```

### **Stage 3: Skill Extraction**
```python
def extract_skills_from_text(text):
    """
    Extracts skills from text using multiple methods
    """
    # 1. Load predefined skill dictionaries
    # 2. Pattern matching for skill mentions

## üéØ Scoring Algorithm

### **Multi-Factor Scoring System:**

#### **1. Skill Matching (40% Weight)**
```python
# Algorithm:
skill_score = (matching_skills / total_required_skills) * 100

# Features:
- Case-insensitive matching
- Partial skill matching
- Skill synonym handling
- Confidence scoring
```

#### **2. Experience Matching (30% Weight)**
```python
# Algorithm:
if candidate_experience >= required_experience:
    experience_score = 100
elif candidate_experience >= required_experience * 0.8:
    experience_score = 80
elif candidate_experience >= required_experience * 0.6:
    experience_score = 60
else:
    experience_score = max(0, (candidate_experience / required_experience) * 100)
```

#### **3. Education Matching (20% Weight)**
```python
# Algorithm:
# Maps education levels to numeric values
education_levels = {
    'high_school': 1,
    'associate': 2,
    'bachelor': 3,
    'master': 4,
    'phd': 5
}

# Compares candidate vs required education level
```

#### **4. Location Matching (10% Weight)**
```python
# Algorithm:
if job_location.lower() == 'remote':
    location_score = 100
elif candidate_location and job_location:
    # Fuzzy string matching for location similarity
    location_score = calculate_location_similarity(candidate_location, job_location)
else:
    location_score = 0
```

### **Overall Score Calculation:**
```python
overall_score = (
    skill_score * 0.4 +
    experience_score * 0.3 +
    education_score * 0.2 +
    location_score * 0.1
)
```
