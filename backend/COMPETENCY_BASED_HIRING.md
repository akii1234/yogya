# üß† Competency-Based Hiring System - Yogya

## üéØ **Why Competency-Based Over Traditional Topic-Based?**

### **‚ùå Traditional Approach (Bias-Prone):**
```
"Tell me about React lifecycle methods."
```
**Problems:**
- Tests memory, not behavior
- Favors candidates who memorized specific topics
- Doesn't predict real-world performance
- High bias risk based on educational background

### **‚úÖ Competency-Based Approach (Bias-Resistant):**
```
"Tell me about a time you debugged a complex frontend issue in a production system. 
What steps did you take?"
```
**Benefits:**
- Tests problem-solving, ownership, and communication
- Evaluates actual behavior and decision-making
- Predicts real-world performance
- Reduces bias by focusing on demonstrated capabilities

## üèóÔ∏è **Enhanced Competency Structure**

### **üî∏ Competency Object Structure**
```json
{
  "title": "Problem Solving",
  "description": "Ability to break down complex problems and implement effective solutions.",
  "evaluation_method": "STAR",
  "evaluation_criteria": [
    "Demonstrates structured thinking",
    "Breaks down problems into sub-tasks",
    "Can debug complex issues independently"
  ],
  "tags": ["Core", "High Priority", "Engineering"],
  "sample_question": "Tell me about a time when you faced a complex technical problem. How did you approach it?",
  "weightage": 20.0
}
```

### **üîπ Core Competencies for Tech Roles**

| Competency | Description | STAR Prompt | Weightage |
|------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Problem Solving** | Logical breakdown, analytical thinking | "Tell me about a time you debugged a critical bug." | 20% |
| **Communication** | Clarity in expressing ideas, especially technical concepts | "Describe a time you had to explain tech to a non-tech stakeholder." | 15% |
| **Collaboration** | Teamwork, conflict resolution | "When did you help a struggling team member?" | 15% |
| **Ownership** | Initiative, accountability | "Give an example where you took ownership of a delivery." | 20% |
| **Learning Agility** | Curiosity, adaptability | "Tell me when you picked up a new tech under tight deadline." | 10% |
| **Technical Depth** | Engineering fundamentals, architecture thinking | "Describe the most complex system you've built or contributed to." | 20% |

## üé≠ **STAR/CAR Methodology**

### **STAR Structure (Situation, Task, Action, Result)**
```json
{
  "situation": "Production bug affecting users",
  "task": "Debug and fix the issue quickly", 
  "action": "Systematic debugging approach",
  "result": "Successfully resolved the issue"
}
```

### **CAR Structure (Context, Action, Result)**
```json
{
  "context": "New feature deployment with tight deadline",
  "action": "Coordinated with team and implemented solution",
  "result": "Delivered on time with high quality"
}
```
