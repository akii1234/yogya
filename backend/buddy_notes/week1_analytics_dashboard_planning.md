## ðŸ¤” **Discussion Points - Let's Explore Together**

### **1. Dashboard Users & Use Cases**

#### **Primary Users:**
- **HR Managers**: Need overview of hiring pipeline and trends
- **Interviewers**: Need session management and candidate progress
- **Hiring Managers**: Need team performance and decision support
- **Candidates**: Need their own progress tracking (future)

#### **Key Questions:**
- **What metrics matter most to each user type?**
- **What actions do they need to take based on the data?**
- **How often do they need to check the dashboard?**
- **What level of detail do they need?**

### **2. Core Dashboard Components**

#### **A. Real-time Interview Dashboard**
**What we're thinking:**
- Live interview session status (scheduled, in-progress, completed)
- Candidate progress through interview stages
- Interviewer availability and workload
- Real-time notifications and alerts

**Questions for you:**
- **What interview stages do we need to track?** (Scheduled â†’ In Progress â†’ Completed â†’ Evaluated)
- **How granular should the progress tracking be?** (Overall vs. competency-by-competency)
- **What notifications are most important?** (Interview starting, completion, evaluation ready)

#### **B. Candidate Progress Tracking**
**What we're thinking:**
- Visual progress indicators (progress bars, status badges)
- Time spent in each stage
- Competency scores and evaluations
- Application timeline and history

**Questions for you:**
- **What progress indicators are most useful?** (Percentage complete, time-based, stage-based)
- **How should we display competency scores?** (Individual scores, overall average, trend over time)
- **What candidate information should be prominent?** (Skills, experience, match score, application date)

#### **C. Interview Session Management**
**What we're thinking:**
- Calendar view of scheduled interviews
- Interview session details and context
- Quick actions (start, pause, complete, reschedule)
- Session notes and evaluations

**Questions for you:**
- **What session information is most important?** (Candidate details, JD, competencies, interviewer)
- **What quick actions should be available?** (Start, pause, complete, reschedule, cancel)
- **How should we handle session notes and evaluations?** (Real-time, post-session, structured forms)

#### **D. Basic Reporting & Insights**
**What we're thinking:**
- Hiring pipeline metrics (applications, interviews, offers, hires)
- Interview performance analytics (completion rates, average scores)
- Competency trend analysis (which competencies are challenging)
- Time-to-hire and conversion rate tracking

**Questions for you:**
- **What are the most important KPIs for hiring success?** (Time-to-hire, conversion rates, quality of hire)
- **How should we measure interview effectiveness?** (Completion rates, score distributions, interviewer feedback)
- **What insights would be most valuable?** (Bottlenecks, trends, recommendations)

### **3. Technical Architecture Questions**

#### **A. Real-time Updates**
**Options:**
- **WebSocket**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **Polling**: Regular API calls to check for updates
- **Server-Sent Events**: One-way real-time updates

**Questions for you:**
- **How real-time does it need to be?** (Instant updates vs. 30-second refresh)
- **What's the expected user load?** (10 users vs. 100+ users)
- **Should we start simple and enhance later?**

#### **B. Data Aggregation**
**Options:**
- **Real-time calculation**: Compute metrics on-demand
- **Pre-aggregated**: Store computed metrics in database
- **Hybrid approach**: Mix of both based on complexity

**Questions for you:**
- **What's the performance requirement?** (Sub-second response vs. 2-3 seconds)
- **How much historical data do we need?** (Last 30 days vs. last year)
- **Should we cache frequently accessed data?**

#### **C. Dashboard Layout & Design**
**Options:**
- **Single-page dashboard**: All metrics on one page
- **Tabbed interface**: Different views for different user types
- **Widget-based**: Customizable dashboard with draggable widgets

**Questions for you:**
- **What's the preferred user experience?** (Simple and clean vs. feature-rich)
- **Should different user types see different dashboards?**
- **Do we need customization options?**

### **4. Data Sources & Integration**

- âœ… **Resumes**: Parsed content, skills, match scores
- âœ… **Applications**: Status, dates, match scores
- âœ… **Competency Frameworks**: Frameworks, competencies, weights
- âœ… **Interview Templates**: Templates, questions, categories
- âœ… **Interview Sessions**: Status, schedule, evaluations

#### **Questions for you:**
- **Are there any data gaps we need to address?**
- **Should we add any new data points for better analytics?**
- **How should we handle data quality and validation?**

### **5. User Experience & Interface**

#### **A. Dashboard Navigation**
**Options:**
- **Top navigation**: Main sections as tabs/buttons
- **Sidebar navigation**: Hierarchical menu structure
- **Breadcrumb navigation**: Show current location and path

**Questions for you:**
- **What's the preferred navigation pattern?**
- **How many main sections should we have?**
- **Should navigation be role-based?**

#### **B. Data Visualization**
**Options:**
