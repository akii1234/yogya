# üß† AI Recommendation Engine - Implementation Documentation

## Overview

The AI Recommendation Engine is a sophisticated system that intelligently recommends interview questions based on job requirements, candidate profiles, and success patterns. It represents the core intelligence of our competency-based hiring platform.

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. **Multi-Factor Scoring Algorithm**
- **Skill Relevance (40%)**: Matches questions to required and candidate skills
- **Difficulty Matching (25%)**: Aligns question difficulty with candidate level
- **Framework Alignment (20%)**: Ensures questions align with competency frameworks
- **Success Rate (15%)**: Considers historical question performance

### 2. **Intelligent Context Analysis**
- **Skill Extraction**: Automatically identifies technical and soft skills from text
- **Level Detection**: Determines candidate level (junior/mid-level/senior)
- **Gap Analysis**: Identifies skill gaps and candidate strengths
- **Focus Areas**: Recommends key areas to probe during interviews

### 3. **Interview Strategy Generation**
- **Flow Recommendations**: Suggests optimal interview structure
- **Time Allocation**: Provides time distribution across question types
- **Red Flags**: Identifies potential warning signs to watch for
- **Success Indicators**: Defines what good responses look like

### Algorithm Details

#### Skill Extraction
```python
def extract_skills_from_text(self, text):
    # Technical skills database
    technical_skills = [
        'python', 'java', 'javascript', 'react', 'django',
        'sql', 'mongodb', 'aws', 'docker', 'kubernetes'
    ]
    
    # Soft skills database
    soft_skills = [
        'communication', 'leadership', 'teamwork', 'problem solving'
    ]
    
    # Extract matching skills from text
    found_skills = []
    for skill in technical_skills + soft_skills:
        if skill in text.lower():
            found_skills.append(skill)
    
    return found_skills
```

#### Difficulty Matching
```python
def calculate_difficulty_match(self, question, candidate_level):
    difficulty_mapping = {
        'junior': {'easy': 1.0, 'medium': 0.7, 'hard': 0.3},
        'mid-level': {'easy': 0.6, 'medium': 1.0, 'hard': 0.7},
        'senior': {'easy': 0.3, 'medium': 0.7, 'hard': 1.0}
    }
    
    return difficulty_mapping.get(candidate_level, {}).get(question.difficulty, 0.5)
```

#### Scoring Algorithm
```python
# Weighted scoring system
score = 0
score += skill_score * 0.4      # 40% weight
score += difficulty_score * 0.25 # 25% weight
score += framework_score * 0.2   # 20% weight
score += success_score * 0.15    # 15% weight
```
